**This document contains a specification for the concept of Analytical Atoms.**

------
Definition:

> Analytical Atoms are "self-contained analysis-ready pieces of information" [1] that can be added to arbitrary data sources to enable flexible (ad-hoc) combinations.

## Motivation

:hourglass_flowing_sand: *Work in progress*

## Scenarios

### Augmentation

Use analytical atoms to extend the functionality of simple data sources (e.g. add persistance, analytics functions and the like)

### Abstraction

Abstract data sources, e.g. to hide information or limit functionality.

### Metadata-based integration

Use metadata to dynamically combine analytical atoms.
